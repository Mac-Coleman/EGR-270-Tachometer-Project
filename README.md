# Strobe Tachometer Project
This is a tachometer project by Claire Gugerty and Mac Coleman.

January 31, 2023.


The plan:

Strobe circuit will be a monostable 555 set to deliver
a pulse on the order of microseconds.

Use time.time_ns() to get time in nanoseconds between rotations.
We will use this to determine the frequency of something.
How that signal will be created will be determined later.
